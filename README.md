Thank you for downloading this set of files to make your own craft cutter cart. You’ll find fusion and step archives of the cart and drawer, as well as dxf (vector) files of each component. This design requires 2 5x5 sheets of 12mm baltic birch plywood and assumes your plywood is truly 1/2”. While this is not always the case, I have found 12mm baltic birch to vary between .490 and .505 inches in actual thickness. The drawer is scaled at 99.5% to allow for some movement and easier opening and closing. I recommend assembling this with Spax brand 1 1/2” MDF+Hardwood T15 self-drilling screws. Glue + brad nails would also be sufficient.

This design is free to use and share - both free as in beer and free as in freedom, and we appreciate you crediting us and sharing alike.

This cart is based on an original design by Jen Schachter of Tested and Savage Industries.
